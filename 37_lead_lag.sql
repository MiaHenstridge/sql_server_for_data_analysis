/*
Exercise 1


Create a query with the following columns:



�PurchaseOrderID� from the Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader table

�OrderDate� from the Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader table

�TotalDue� from the Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader table

�Name� from the Purchasing.Vendor table, which can be aliased as �VendorName�*

*Join Purchasing.Vendor to Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader on BusinessEntityID = VendorID



Apply the following criteria to the query:

Order must have taken place on or after 2013

TotalDue must be greater than $500

	A.OrderDate,
	A.TotalDue,

	LEFT JOIN AdventureWorks2019.Purchasing.Vendor B
		ON A.VendorID = B.BusinessEntityID
WHERE YEAR(A.OrderDate) >= 2013
	AND A.TotalDue > 500


/*
Exercise 2


Modify your query from Exercise 1 by adding a derived column called

"PrevOrderFromVendorAmt", that returns the �previous� TotalDue value (relative to the current row) within the group of all orders with the same vendor ID. We are defining �previous� based on order date.

		ON A.VendorID = B.BusinessEntityID
WHERE YEAR(A.OrderDate) >= 2013
	AND A.TotalDue > 500


/*
Exercise 3


Modify your query from Exercise 2 by adding a derived column called

"NextOrderByEmployeeVendor", that returns the �next� vendor name (the �name� field from Purchasing.Vendor) within the group of all orders that have the same EmployeeID value in Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader. Similar to the last exercise, we are defining �next� based on order date.

/*
Exercise 4


Modify your query from Exercise 3 by adding a derived column called "Next2OrderByEmployeeVendor" that returns, within the group of all orders that have the same EmployeeID, the vendor name offset TWO orders into the �future� relative to the order in the current row. The code should be very similar to Exercise 3, but with an extra argument passed to the Window Function used.
